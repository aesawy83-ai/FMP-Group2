# Facade Crack Detection using YOLOv8
## Problem Statement
Facade cracks can indicate structural deterioration in buildings. 
Manual inspection is time-consuming and subjective.

This project develops a YOLOv8-based object detection model 
to automatically detect facade cracks from images 
to support early-stage structural inspection workflows.

Success criteria:
- Achieve strong detection performance (mAP@0.5 ≥ 0.75)
- Maintain reliable detection across lighting variations

## Dataset

Source: Roboflow  
Project: facade-cracks  
Format: YOLOv8

## Reproduce in Google Colab

1. Open `notebooks/M4U3.ipynb` in Colab.
2. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU.
3. Run all cells.
4. Training outputs will be saved in `/runs/detect/`.

## Governance & Limitations

This model is intended for inspection assistance only.
Human validation is required before structural decisions.
